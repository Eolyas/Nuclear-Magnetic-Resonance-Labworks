# Nuclear-Magnetic-Resonance-Labworks
The goal of this lab work was to experiment with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance in ferromagnets and perform basic measurements on ferromagnets using the spin-echo sequence. The sample studied were a thin layer of Cobalt-Iron (at room temperature and at 77 $K$) and a pure Cobalt sample (at room temperature). The measurements yielded values of \dots
